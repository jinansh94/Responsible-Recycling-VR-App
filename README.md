# Responsible-Recycling-VR-App

I have made a VR Application using Unity for Google CardBoard

The project is just a small drop in the ocean. An initiative towards a sustainable environment. The project is a VR project which gives a life-like experience to the user. Recycling involves a lot of cost and as a result, not many things are recycled. In order to create awareness about proper waste segregation and about recycling responsibly, I decided to prepare a VR project which will be a fun learning experience for all.

​

In the VR experience, the user is represented in the first person view. The video depicts a city area surrounded by multiple buildings. There is waste lying around on the road. The user can go around the area. To pick up waste, the user needs to focus on the waste object for 2 seconds. Once the waste has been targeted, a hint will be displayed in the same color as that of the bin to which the waste belongs to. The user can then go towards the bin and put the object in the correct bin (blue: recycle, brown: compost and green: non-recyclable).

 

Through the VR Experience, the user can learn about different types of waste and about how to responsibly dispose off waste.

​

I have used multiple 3D objects in the project. These are:

1. 19 buildings - White city (Unit Asset Store)

2. 12 trees - Tree9 (Unity Asset Store)

3. 6 street lamps (3D Warehouse)

4. 1 fountain (3D Warehouse)

5. 2 bench (3D Warehouse)

6. 3 picnic table (3D Warehouse)

7. Garbage models (3D Warehouse and Unity Store)

8. 3 wastebins -trash_can (Unity Asset Store)

9. 1 suite man - StudioNewPunch (Unity Asset Store)

10. 1 3D people model (3D Warehouse)
